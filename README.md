# Hi.

This is a coding exercise implementing **React JS** and **Material UI** library.

Also, I used a fake example of chart made with Chart.js and the react-chartjs-2 plugin.

You can see this project delpoyed on https://cav-mui.netlify.app/

An implementation of **Storybook** for 2 core Components is deployed on https://cav-mui-storybook.netlify.app/ .

## Basic instalation

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
