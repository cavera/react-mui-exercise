# Hi.

This is a coding exercise implementing React JS and Material UI library.

All of the measurements were based on the image provided, and I used [this Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/LFx7tsY4z90v6esMr7YWR0/Exercise-measures?type=design&node-id=103%3A4&t=c3xo5GWX8adl19Lo-1) to try to make the exercise near-pixel perfect.

## Basic instalation

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
